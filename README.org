~app-launcher~ define the ~app-launcher-run-app~ command which uses Emacs 
standard completion feature to select an application installed on your machine and launch it.


** How to install using Emacs' built-in ~use-package~
If you're using Emacs version 30 or later, you can leverage the built-in ~use-package~ 
with the new ~:vc~ option:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package app-launcher
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/SebastienWae/app-launcher"
       :branch "main")
  :ensure t
  :commands (app-launcher-run-app))
#+END_SRC


** How to install with ~straight.el~
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(straight-use-package
  '(app-launcher :type git :host github :repo "SebastienWae/app-launcher"))
#+END_SRC
Or if you are using ~use-package~ (thanks [[https://github.com/daviwil][@daviwil]])
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package app-launcher
  :straight '(app-launcher :host github :repo "SebastienWae/app-launcher"))
#+END_SRC
